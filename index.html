  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Yangocean</strong> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following data to improve your experience and for analytics purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data you provide during emotional check-ins (mood ratings, EFT rounds, optional notes).</li>
    <li>Anonymous demographic or activity data (age, education level, sleep quality) linked only via a program-generated user ID.</li>
    <li>Device and usage data (e.g., app version, device type) for performance and analytics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as name, email, or phone number.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide insights and help you track emotional trends anonymously.</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and features.</li>
    <li>To generate aggregated statistics for internal analytics, health, wellness, or educational research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All analytics data is anonymized and cannot identify any individual user.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use secure cloud services and encryption where applicable to protect your data. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may delete your anonymous user data through the app at any time.</li>
    <li>You may choose not to provide optional information within the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App can be used by all users, including those under 16. We do not collect or store personally identifiable information from users under 16. Only anonymous activity data (e.g., mood, sleep quality) may be stored for aggregated insights.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses trusted third-party services such as Supabase for data storage. These services have their own privacy policies governing how they handle information. See <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy" target="_blank">Supabase Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
