  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>EFT Tapping by Mind n Body365</strong> (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect certain information to improve your experience, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information you provide during emotional check-ins (such as mood ratings and notes).</li>
    <li>Device and usage data (e.g., app version, device type, and general analytics).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, contact details, or address) unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., through account registration).</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide personalized insights and help you track emotional trends over time.</li>
    <li>To improve the App’s performance and features.</li>
    <li>To generate anonymized, aggregated statistics that may be used for health, wellness, or educational research purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We may share <strong>only anonymized and aggregated data</strong> (not linked to any individual user) with health organizations, researchers, or educational institutions to support emotional wellbeing research.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use secure cloud services and encryption where applicable to protect your data. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may delete your data or request account removal at any time.</li>
    <li>You may choose not to provide optional information within the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App can be used by all users, including those under 16. For users aged 16 and below, we do not collect or store personal data such as name, email, or location. Only anonymized activity data (e.g., sleep quality, daily activity) may be stored for aggregate insights. If we become aware that any personal data from a user under 16 has been collected, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses trusted third-party services such as Supabase for data storage and authentication. These services have their own privacy policies governing how they handle information.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected with a revised “Last updated” date above.</p>
